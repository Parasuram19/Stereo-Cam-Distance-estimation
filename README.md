# Stereo Camera Distance Estimation

This project implements stereo vision and triangulation techniques to estimate the distance to objects from a stereo camera setup.

## Overview

This project utilizes two cameras (a stereo camera setup) to capture images of a scene. By applying stereo vision algorithms, corresponding points in the two images are identified.  Triangulation is then used to calculate the 3D coordinates of these points, including the distance from the cameras.  This distance information can be crucial for various applications like robotics, autonomous navigation, and 3D reconstruction.

## Features

* **Stereo Calibration:**  *(If included)*  Provides tools or scripts for calibrating the stereo camera system to determine intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.  This is essential for accurate distance estimation.
* **Disparity Map Calculation:** Computes a disparity map from the stereo image pair.  The disparity map represents the horizontal shift between corresponding points in the two images, which is inversely proportional to the distance. *(Specify the disparity map algorithm used, e.g., Block Matching, Semi-Global Block Matching (SGBM), StereoSGBM, or any deep learning-based methods.)*
* **Triangulation:**  Calculates the 3D coordinates of points using triangulation based on the disparity map and camera parameters.
* **Distance Estimation:** Extracts the distance (depth) information from the 3D coordinates.
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features (e.g., point cloud generation, object detection combined with distance estimation).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **OpenCV (cv2):** For image processing, stereo vision algorithms, and camera calibration.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Bash

pip install numpy
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries (see above).
Stereo Camera Setup: You'll need a stereo camera setup (two cameras positioned with a known baseline).
Calibration Data: (If applicable) If you're not using pre-calibrated cameras, you might need calibration data (images of a calibration pattern).
